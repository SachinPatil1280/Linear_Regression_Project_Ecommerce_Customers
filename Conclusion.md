# Interpreting the coefficients:

◉ Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Avg. Session Length is associated with an increase of 25.98 total dollars spent.

◉ Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Time on App is associated with an increase of 38.59 total dollars spent.

◉ Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Time on Website is associated with an increase of 0.19 total dollars spent.

◉ Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Length of Membership is associated with an increase of 61.27 total dollars spent.



# Conclusion
We can interpret this data to make certain observations, for example:- If all other factors are kept constant then increasing the "Avg. Session Length" by one unit will increase the yearly amount spent by a customer by an estimate of $26.

Similarly, increasing "Time on App" by one unit increases the yearly amount spent by $38.5, whereas increasing Time on Website by one unit increases the yearly amount spent by only $0.6 approximately.

According to the data above, the largest increase of approximately $61.5 is observed when the "Length of Membership" is increased by one unit.

Using the predictions above we can develop ways to increase the yearly amount spent by the customers. We can improve the app experience so that the users spend more of their time on the app, or we can also focus on the website and develop it so that it becomes as efficient as the app, or we can focus on customer relationships so that people remain members for long periods.
you would probably want to explore the relationship between the Length of Membership and the App or the Website before concluding!
